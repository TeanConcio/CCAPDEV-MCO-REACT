  "body": "Just occurred to me that the Team Rocket Trio are the perfect example of the more progressive social theories of crime. Let me explain: Jesse, James, and Meowth really don't seem like very bad people. Yeah, they do bad things sometimes but time and again, we see them put others' needs before theirs, care for the Pokemon they work with, and they even showed up at Ash' final battle to cheer him on. In one of the manga, they literally gave up a life of crime to start a family. SO WHY JOIN TEAM ROCKET? Beacause, they basically had no other choice. Jessie grew up a poor foster kid. James was a runaway. Meowth, a literal alley cat. It's been a while since I watched the anime but they did try to go straight and legit when they were younger but it didn't work so they turned to organized crime. This is like the background of Team Skull in Sun and Moon; the team is made up of disaffected youth who failed their Island Challenges and have been rejected by society so they decided to band together for safety and companionship. Much like actual, real-life gangs. Wow yeah so it's almost like, when given no alternative options and largely shunned by society, poor people often turn to crime. ",
